QGIS Tester Plugin's documentation
==================================

The QGIS Tester plugin is a tool to help to perform systematic testing
QGIS Core or QGIS plugin's functionality. It allows creating automatic
tests, that run without the tester intervention and semi-automated tests, where
step by step instructions are presented to the tester to perform manual tasks, but
possible to automate tasks that are performed automatically (e.g. load a specific
project) to speed up the process.
