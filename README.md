# Tester [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qcooperative/qgis-tester-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qcooperative/qgis-tester-plugin)

The QGIS Tester plugin is a tool to help test QGIS core and plugins' functionality.
It allows for creating automatic and semi-automated tests. The first runs without
the tester intervention. The second also includes step-by-step instructions to
perform manual or verification tasks.

This plugin was originally developed by Victor Olaya at Boundless.
